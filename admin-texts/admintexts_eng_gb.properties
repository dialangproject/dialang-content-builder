ExpRealLife_Bullet1 = Anxiety
ExpOtherTests_Par1 = Tests we take at school, at the workplace or elsewhere can often give us an idea of how good our language proficiency is but it is important to realise that the results of different tests can mean very different things.

ExpTimeAllowed_Par1 = In most tests you have only a limited amount of time at your disposal to complete the tasks whereas in real life, you may have more time available, like, for example, when you read a text. But the opposite can also be true: you may find some real-life situations more difficult than the test because you need to comprehend and react more quickly than in the test situation.
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Writing_#A1_#Item5_#EN = Try to learn how new words are typically formed in English.
LangTest_ItemFeedback_YourAnswer = Your answer:
Explanatory_Main_Header = Why self-assessment and test results may not match

Caption_No = No
ExpDiffTests_Par2 = Purpose of the test: a test which is used to give you an end-of-course grade will probably not give you the same information as a test aimed at measuring your skills in absolute terms, against an international scale, which tells you what learners at that level can do in real life.

TestResults_Text#Vocabulary#C2 = Your test result suggests that you are at level C2 in vocabulary on the Council of Europe scale.
ExpSituation_Bullet3 = On the other hand, your ability to use the language across different content areas and situations may be more fully developed than you thought. This may be related to other factors but it could also be that the contexts you use language in (e.g. for general social purposes) help you greatly in developing important aspects such as vocabulary and thus allow you to operate across a wide range of language use contexts.
AdvisoryTable_Row3_Text_#Writing_#C2 = No need to consult a dictionary, except for occasional specialist terms in an unfamiliar area.
Title_FatalError = Fatal error
AdvisoryTable_Row3_Text_#Listening_#B1 = Clear, standard speech.<br /><br />Will require the help of visuals and action.<br /><br />Will sometimes ask for repetition of a word or phrase.

TestResults_Text#Vocabulary#B2 = Your test result suggests that you are at level B2 in vocabulary on the Council of Europe scale.
ExpTargets_Par1 = How high you set your target level for language learning may affect how you rate your proficiency. For example, if you are a beginner or an intermediate learner and you set your target to be native-like proficiency, you will have a long way to go and you may feel that you are making such slow progress that you cannot possibly be very good - you may consequently underrate yourself.
ChooseTest_Skill#Listening = Listening
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Reading_#A1_#Item6_#EL = Use whatever opportunities you can to read or listen to Greek or use Greek: at this level, any exposure to Greek whether reading, writing, listening or speaking is likely to help you improve your reading ability.
ExpOverestimate_Par2 = In the same way, you may have found speaking quite easy and consider that you can make yourself understood in most contexts, especially in those that you are familiar with. However, you may find writing (especially more formal writing) problematic because many writing contexts may require a higher level of accuracy than comparable speaking contexts. And you may find that texts and speech which contain a lot of densely packed, abstract information and ideas may be hard to understand because in your speaking you might have been in a position to choose when, what and how to speak and thus avoid using those expressions that you are not familiar with.
ChooseTest_Language#fin_fi = FINNISH

ExpIntTests_Par1 = In some languages learners can take international language tests, that is, tests that are administered and recognised in many countries. As with some school-based or national tests, some of these international tests can give you a fairly good idea where you stand against an international yardstick such as the Council of Europe six-point scale. However, you need to study what the test producers say about the meaning of their grades: some may report their results by using descriptions which are different from those used in the Council of Europe scale. To what extent do the two descriptions match or differ?
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Listening_#C1_#Item2_#IT = Increase your exposure to non-standard and regional usage of Italian, so that you get used to its characteristics.
SelfAssessFeedback_UnderEst_Par2 = If you have a tendency to under-estimate your own proficiency, this could prevent you from setting meaningful and realistic goals for your language learning.

AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Writing_#A2_#Item5_#NL = Try to write something every day in Dutch; keep a diary, for example. 
Explanatory_Main_Menu_OtherTests = Other tests and DIALANG
ExpRealLife_Par1 = A test situation is always somewhat different from 'real-life' situations where you use a language in order to communicate with other people, to acquire new knowledge and so on. Some tests and some test tasks may attempt to simulate the demands of real-life communication but they can do so only to a limited extent. This difference in purpose and context can result in your not demonstrating the same kind of skills and knowledge in a test that you would do outside, in the real world.
Subskill#Vocabulary.WF = Word formation
SelfAssessFeedback_UnderEst_Par1#C1#A1 = In the self-assessment task you gave responses which we would normally expect from a learner at level A1.  However, your test result suggests that you are at level C1.
Title_SelfAssess#Listening = Self-assessment - listening
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Listening_#C1_#Item1_#SV = Listen to radio programmes, watch TV and films in Swedish on a regular basis.

AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Listening_#A2_#Item3_#ES = If there is something on the radio or on TV in Spanish, make a point of listening to the speech and try to understand the main point and do not worry about individual words that you miss.
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Writing_#A1_#Item3_#SV = Use whatever opportunities you can to read or listen to Swedish or use Swedish: at this level, any exposure to Swedish is likely to help you improve your writing ability.
ExpSchoolTests_Par1 = Language tests at schools and other educational institutions often aim at ranking students in order to give them grades on the basis of mastery of the course or curriculum content. These tests may be valid for the purpose for which they are used but it is difficult for learners to draw conclusions about their absolute level of proficiency or about the meaning of the test results in terms of their ability to do things with the language. If your view of your language skills is mainly based on your school grades and tests at school, you may find it difficult to compare that against an international scale of proficiency such as the Council of Europe scale used in DIALANG. The content and standards (level of proficiency) required in school examinations vary from country to country, and even within one country, and it is thus difficult to relate these local standards to a wider, international standard.
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Listening_#A2_#Item3_#DE = If there is something on the radio or on TV in German, make a point of listening to the speech and try to understand the main point and do not worry about individual words that you miss.
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Listening_#B1_#Item1_#SV = Increase the range and type of texts you listen to, including non-standard uses of Swedish.
Title_PlacementFeedback = Placement test feedback
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Listening_#B1_#Item2_#DA = If you can see films with the original soundtrack in Danish, make a point of watching them. Subtitles, either in your own language or in the target language are useful; remember to listen too, however.
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Listening_#B1_#Item2_#EN = If you can see films with the original soundtrack in English, make a point of watching them. Subtitles, either in your own language or in the target language are useful; remember to listen too, however.
TestResults_Text#Listening#B1 = Your test result suggests that you are at level B1 in listening on the Council of Europe scale. At this level, people can understand the main points of clear "standard" speech on familiar matters connected with work, school, leisure etc. In TV and radio current-affair programmes or programmes of personal or professional interest, they can understand the main points provided the speech is relatively slow and clear.
Welcome_Chart_ChooseTest_Text = The first thing you do is choose a test to take.  Choose any combination of language and skill from those available.
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Listening_#C1_#Item1_#ES = Listen to radio programmes, watch TV and films in Spanish on a regular basis.

Subskill#Structures.11 = Nouns
ExpWorkTests_Par1 = Many learners take language tests as a part of their language training at work. Work-based language tests can often be very specific in terms of content and the kind of language required - specific to the needs of the occupation or profession in question. Because DIALANG is an assessment system that covers a range of general contexts and situations of language use, it is difficult to compare these two kinds of tests: your ability to use the language required in your work may not be at the same level as your general language proficiency. Also, it may be difficult to compare the standards (levels of proficiency) required in the different tests.
ChooseTest_Language#dan_dk = DANISH
FeedbackMenu_Glosses_CheckAnswers = Check your answers against the correct answers
AdvisoryTable_Intro_#A1 = The table below shows some of the key differences between A1 and the level above (A2):

Title_FeedbackResultsAdvice = Feedback: results and advice
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Listening_#C1_#Item1_#NO = Listen to radio programmes, watch TV and films in Norwegian on a regular basis.
ExpCompareOthers_Par2 = If you come across only a few learners of the language you are studying, it may be difficult to see the full range of skills and proficiency levels that exist. If you were in class with the weakest language learners at school or if you mainly meet learners who are clearly better than yourself, this might lead you to underestimate your skills. On the other hand, if you were among the best learners at school or you come across only less advanced learners, this might give you the impression that you are more advanced than you really are.
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Reading_#A2_#Item2_#EN = Pay special attention to particular expressions, phrases and words in English used for argumentation, description and to express feelings and wishes.
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Reading_#A1_#Item1_#SV = Attend language classes so that you learn more sentence level grammar and Swedish vocabulary, paying attention to sentence formation and connecting main and subordinate clauses.

ExpInfrequently_Par2 = The more opportunities you have had to use the language in different situations and for different purposes, the better the chances are that you have developed a fairly accurate picture of what you can and cannot do with the language. The fewer opportunities you have had, the more difficult it is to get an idea of how good you really are.
Title_FeedbackMenu = Feedback Menu
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Listening_#A2_#Item3_#IT = If there is something on the radio or on TV in Italian, make a point of listening to the speech and try to understand the main point and do not worry about individual words that you miss.

AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Reading_#A2_#Item1_#DE = Increase the range and type of texts you actively try to read. You might like to look at newspapers and magazines in German and work at one or two of the more difficult articles which interest you, with a dictionary if necessary.
Caption_InstantFeedbackOff = Turn immediate feedback off
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Writing_#A2_#Item4_#ES = Pay attention to how to express politeness in Spanish: impoliteness can be more irritating than linguistic errors and prevent you from achieving the aims you have for your letter or message.
TestResults_Text#Writing#A1 = Your test result suggests that you are at or below level A1 in writing on the Council of Europe scale. At this level, people can write a short simple postcard, for example sending holiday greetings. They can fill in forms with personal details, for example writing their name, nationality and address on a hotel registration form.

Disclaimer_UseMisuse = DIALANG is a diagnostic test.  Its main purpose is to inform language learners about their level and about language learning.  DIALANG should NOT be used for certification purposes.<br /><br />Scroll down for more information ...<br /><br />DIALANG is a diagnostic test which gives you information about the strengths and weaknesses in your proficiency.  DIALANG does not give you a certificate which you could use, for example, to apply for a job or entry to an educational institution.  If you need such a certificate, you should take a language test offered by an officially recognized testing board either in your own country or abroad.<br /><br />DIALANG may help you decide which examination you would be able to pass, or whether you need to study a language further before taking such a test.<br /><br />DIALANG reports your level on a scale which divides language into 6 levels of proficiency, covering the full range of proficiency from beginner to very advanced.  This makes DIALANG more suited to measuring long-term rather than short-term improvement (or decline).  Note also that it is generally easier and quicker to progress from a lower level (e.g. A1 to A2) than from a higher level (e.g. B2 to C1).<br /><br />A note to course administrators:<br /><br />DIALANG tests which are fully calibrated could be used for placing students informally into different types and levels of instruction.  Check however that course content has sufficient similarity to the Common European Framework before using DIALANG for this purpose.  Make sure also that it is possible for the student to change course should the placement decision turn out to be wrong.<br /><br />For more information about the matters discussed above see also 'About Self-assessment' which you can find in the Feedback menu after taking a DIALANG test.

ExpAnxiety_Par1 = Certain tests can be so important for your later life (work, studies) that you feel very nervous when taking them. Although DIALANG is not such a high-stakes test, you may still feel nervous when doing the tasks. The stress that a test causes may hamper some people's performance, but others may do better just because of the challenge. Some people may not be affected at all.
ExpIntTests_Head = DIALANG and other international language tests

LangTest_Rubric#ShortAnswer#Text = Read the text, and type your answer(s) into the box(es) provided. Check your spelling!
ExpFamiliarity_Par1 = Tests typically use a range of different task types (e.g. multiple-choice, gap-filling, interview) to enable a fairer assessment of learners' skills, and you may not have come across of them. The tasks can also vary in terms of their complexity (the number and kind of steps you need to take in order to complete the task) and even the best instructions may not make it entirely clear to all learners what exactly they are supposed to do. An unfamiliar or complex task may prevent you from showing what you can do with the language.

AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Writing_#C1_#Item1 = Try to notice and "collect" idiomatic phrases, paying attention to the contexts in which they appear. Notice phrases for emphasizing your point of view, for instance ways to introduce counter-arguments or highlight the newness or importance of one's own point of view.

ExpUnderestimate_Par1 = Your past experience in a particular skill may lead you to underestimate your ability in other areas. For example, learners who concentrate on studying grammar and vocabulary and on avoiding errors when they use language may think that their speaking and writing are poor because of the errors they feel they are making. Sometimes this feeling is reinforced by feedback from a teacher who may emphasise learners' problems and fail to acknowledge what learners can do with the language, despite all the errors. As a result, such learners may be surprised to get a higher grade on a language test than they expected because they had been paying attention to only one or a few aspects of proficiency (e.g. accuracy), whereas the test covers language proficiency in a more comprehensive way.
SelfAssessFeedback_UnderEst_Par1#C2#C1 = In the self-assessment task you gave responses which we would normally expect from a learner at level C1.  However, your test result suggests that you are at level C2.

ExpOtherTests_Par2 = DIALANG encourages you as a language learner to critically evaluate what kind of information is useful for your learning. It may be that language test scores and other feedback that you get from tests are useful for you to plan and monitor your own learning, but it may also be that they are not. You need to evaluate the plausibility and usefulness of any test result or other information that you get from tests you have taken or will take in the future.
Caption_Available = available
SelfAssessFeedback_NoTest_Par1#C2 = In the self-assessment task you gave responses which we would normally expect from a learner at level C2.  You did not complete the language test, so we cannot compare the result with your self-assessment score.

Subskill#Writing.IA = Accuracy
ExpNumber_Par1 = Even a long and comprehensive language test can only contain a fairly limited number of tasks, simply for practical reasons. Your real-life experience (and therefore your self-assessment) may be based on many, many instances of language use.

AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Reading_#A2_#Item1_#FI = Increase the range and type of texts you actively try to read. You might like to look at newspapers and magazines in Finnish and work at one or two of the more difficult articles which interest you, with a dictionary if necessary.
ExpOverestimate_Par1 = It is possible that you are able to read a variety of different texts in another language without too much difficulty (especially if they are about topics that you know about).

AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Reading_#A1_#Item6_#NL = Use whatever opportunities you can to read or listen to Dutch or use Dutch: at this level, any exposure to Dutch whether reading, writing, listening or speaking is likely to help you improve your reading ability.

If you think it is an invented word, press the 'No' button.<br /><br />You do not have to take the placement test, and you may abandon it part way through, but if you do abandon it, you may later get a test which is too hard or too easy.   Therefore we strongly advise you to finish the test.
