                <h1 id="welcome-title">Welcome to DIALANG</h1>
                <p id="welcome-text">Welcome to DIALANG's on-line diagnostic language testing system.  DIALANG will help you to discover how good you are in reading, listening, writing, vocabulary or grammar, and how you can improve.  It will also help you to assess and understand your own language abilities.</p>
                <div id="procedure-title">The PROCEDURE</div>
                <p id="procedure-text">The DIALANG system consists of several stages.  Click on the image below to find out what each stage is about.  Press the Forward button to go to the first stage.</p>

You are asked to respond to a number of statements about your ability to use or understand a language.  This task encourages you to reflect on your own language skills, which helps you to learn more effectively.  It may be that you under- or over-estimate your abilities, and if you appear to do so, DIALANG will tell you.">

Please note that if you skipped both the placement test and the self-assessment, you may be given a test which is too hard or too easy for you.   There are different types of question: in some you will need to type in your answer; in others you simply choose the correct answer from a list of alternatives.  You must complete the test, or you will not get a result.">

As well as the results of your language and placement tests, you will be offered useful information and expert advice.  You can check your answers against the correct answers. You can find out what your results actually mean, and get advice on how to continue developing your language skills.  You can also find out more about your self-assessment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From here, you can quit the program, or you can choose another test.
