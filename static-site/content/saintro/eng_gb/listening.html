                <h1 id="saintro-title">Self-assessment - listening</h1>
                <div id="saintro-text">On the next screen you will be given a self-assessment questionnaire, in which you are asked to make judgements about your abilities in the language and the skill which you have chosen to take a test in.<br /><br />You will be presented with a number of statements, in no particular order, and you have to decide whether each one applies to you or not. Press the 'Yes' button if it does, and the 'No' button if it does not.<br /><br />The results of this questionnaire are used for two purposes. First, they help to determine the level of the test that you should be given, and second, they will be compared with your test result, to see whether you have a realistic assessment of your level.<br /><br />If you do not attempt or complete the questionnaire, the information cannot be used to help choose which test to give you.</div>
