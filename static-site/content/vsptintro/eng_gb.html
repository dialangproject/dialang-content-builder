                <h1 id="vsptintro-title">Placement Test</h1>
                <div id="vsptintro-text">This test is used to estimate the size of your vocabulary in the test language. It is used to determine which test items to present to you subsequently for an assessment of your language level.<br /><br />In the test, you will be presented with a collection of 'words', some of which are real, and some of which are invented.<br /><br />All the 'words' are verbs, for example, 'to speak', 'to run', 'to eat', and so on.<br /><br />For each word, you must press the 'Yes' button if you think the word exists. If you think it is an invented word, press the 'No' button.<br /><br />You do not have to take the placement test, and you may abandon it part way through, but if you do abandon it, you may later get a test which is too hard or too easy.   Therefore we strongly advise you to finish the test.</div>
